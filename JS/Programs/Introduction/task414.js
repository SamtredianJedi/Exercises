 * JavaScript Math: Exercise-96 with Solution
Write a JavaScript program that calculates the factorial of a number and returns the number of trailing zeroes.

In mathematics, the factorial of a non-negative integer n, denoted by n!, is the product of all positive integers less than or equal to n. The factorial of n also equals the product of n with the next smaller factorial:
n! = n x (n-1) x (n-2) x (n-3)x.....x 3 x 2 x 1
= n x (n-1)!
For example 4! = 4 x 3! = 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 =24
The value of 0! is 1, according to the convention for an empty product.
