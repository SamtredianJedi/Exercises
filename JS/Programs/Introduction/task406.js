Write a JavaScript program to check whether two vectors are orthogonal or not.

Two vectors are orthogonal if they are perpendicular to each other. i.e. the dot product of the two vectors is zero.
Let u and v are two vectors. The vectors u, v will be orthogonal if they are perpendicular, i.e., they form a right angle, or if the dot product they yield is zero.
u⊥v or u•v=0
