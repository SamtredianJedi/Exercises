 JavaScript Function: Exercise-10 with Solution
A palindrome is a word, number, phrase, or other sequence of symbols that reads the same backwards as forwards, such as the words madam or racecar, the date/time stamps 11/11/11 11:11 and 02/02/2020, and the sentence: "A man, a plan, a canal â€“ Panama".
Write a JavaScript program to check whether a given string is Palindrome or not using recursion.
