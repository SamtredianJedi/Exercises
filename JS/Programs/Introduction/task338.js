JavaScript Math: Exercise-20 with Solution
Write a JavaScript program to evaluate binomial coefficients.

Note:
Binomial coefficient : According to Wikipedia - In mathematics, binomial coefficients are a family of positive integers that occur as coefficients in the binomial theorem. They are indexed by two nonnegative integers; the binomial coefficient indexed by n and k is usually written \tbinom nk. It is the coefficient of the x k term in the polynomial expansion of the binomial power (1 + x) n. Under suitable circumstances the value of the coefficient is given by the expression :

Binomial coefficients
Arranging binomial coefficients into rows for successive values of n, and in which k ranges from 0 to n, gives a triangular array called Pascal's triangle.

Test Data:
console.log(binomial(8,3));
console.log(binomial(10,2));
Output :
56
45
