Write a JavaScript program to check whether a given integer is a Repdigit or not.

From Wikipedia -
In recreational mathematics, a repdigit or sometimes monodigit is a natural number composed of repeated instances of the same digit in a positional number system (often implicitly decimal). The word is a portmanteau of repeated and digit. Examples are 11, 666, 4444, and 999999.
