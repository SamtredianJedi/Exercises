// Calculate the Area of a Triangle



/**
 * 
 * In this example, you'll learn to write a program to calculate the area of a triangle in JavaScript.

To understand this example, you should have the knowledge of the following JavaScript programming topics:

JavaScript Operators
JavaScript Math sqrt()
If you know the base and height of a triangle, you can find the area using the formula:

area = (base * height) / 2
Example 1: Area When Base and Height is Known


const baseValue = prompt('Enter the base of a triangle: ');
const heightValue = prompt('Enter the height of a triangle: ');

// calculate the area
const areaValue = (baseValue * heightValue) / 2;

console.log(
  `The area of the triangle is ${areaValue}`
);


If you know all the sides of a triangle, you can find the area using Herons' formula. If a, b and c are the three sides of a triangle, then

s = (a+b+c)/2
area = âˆš(s(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c))
Example 2: Area When All Sides are Known




// JavaScript program to find the area of a triangle

const side1 = parseInt(prompt('Enter side1: '));
const side2 = parseInt(prompt('Enter side2: '));
const side3 = parseInt(prompt('Enter side3: '));

// calculate the semi-perimeter
const s = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2;

//calculate the area
const areaValue = Math.sqrt(
  s * (s - side1) * (s - side2) * (s - side3)
);

console.log(
  `The area of the triangle is ${areaValue}`
);




Here, we have used the Math.sqrt() method to find the square root of a number.

Note: If a triangle cannot be formed from the given sides, the program will not run correctly.
