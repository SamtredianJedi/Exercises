Write a JavaScript function to get the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two integers.
Note:
According to Wikipedia - In mathematics, the greatest common divisor (gcd) of two or more integers, when at least one of them is not zero, is the largest positive integer that divides the numbers without a remainder. For example, the GCD of 8 and 12 is 4.

Test Data :
console.log(gcd_two_numbers(12, 13));
console.log(gcd_two_numbers(9, 3));
Output :
