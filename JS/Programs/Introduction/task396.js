Write a JavaScript program that takes an integer n and return the nth Tetrahedral number.

A tetrahedral number, or triangular pyramidal number, is a figurate number that represents a pyramid with a triangular base and three sides, called a tetrahedron. The formula for the nth tetrahedral number is represented by the 3rd rising factorial of n divided by the factorial of 3:



The tetrahedral numbers are:
1, 4, 10, 20, 35, 56, 84, 120, 165, 220, ...
Test Data:
(1) -> 1
(2) -> 4
(3) -> 10
(4) -> 20
(5) -> 35
