 JavaScript Conditional Statement and loops: Exercise-8 with Solution
Happy Numbers:

According to Wikipedia a happy number is defined by the following process : "Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits, and repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1. Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy numbers, while those that do not end in 1 are unhappy numbers (or sad numbers)". Write a JavaScript program to find and print the first 5 happy numbers.
