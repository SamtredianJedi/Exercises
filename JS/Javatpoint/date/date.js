 // Date Example

 // Current Date and Time: <span id="txt"></span>  

 // var today=new Date();  
 // document.getElementById('txt').innerHTML=today;  

 var date = new Date();
 var day = date.getDate();
 var month = date.getMonth() + 1;
 var year = date.getFullYear();
 document.write("<br>Date is: " + day + "/" + month + "/" + year);


 // Current time example

 var today = new Date();
 var h = today.getHours();
 var m = today.getMinutes();
 var s = today.getSeconds();
 document.getElementById('txt').innerHTML = h + ":" + m + ":" + s;

 // Digital Clock Example

 window.onload = function() { getTime(); }

 function getTime() {
     var today = new Date();
     var h = today.getHours();
     var m = today.getMinutes();
     var s = today.getSeconds();
     // add a zero in front of numbers<10  
     m = checkTime(m);
     s = checkTime(s);
     document.getElementById('txt').innerHTML = h + ":" + m + ":" + s;
     setTimeout(function() { getTime() }, 1000);
 }
 //setInterval("getTime()",1000);//another way  
 function checkTime(i) {
     if (i < 10) {
         i = "0" + i;
     }
     return i;
 }
