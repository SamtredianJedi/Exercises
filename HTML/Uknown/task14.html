<!-- JavaScript | Function call example with given number of arguments and less arguments -->



JavaScript function call example: Here, we are going to learn what happens/prints when a function is called with less number of arguments or no arguments? Submitted by Pankaj Singh, on October 12, 2018 Example: Here, we are defining a JavaScript function
named show() which has two arguments id and name and calling the function, with 1) both arguments, 2) one argument and 3) no argument. Code:

<html lang="en">

<head>
    <script>
        function show(id, name) {
            document.write("Your name is <b>" + name + "</b> and your id is <b>" + id + "</b><br /><br />");
        }
    </script>
</head>

<body>
    <script>
        show(12, "pankaj");
        show(12);
        show();
    </script>
</body>
