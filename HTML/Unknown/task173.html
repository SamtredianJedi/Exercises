<!-- How can I determine if a variable is 'undefined' or 'null'


-->



<!-- What are Undefined and Null Variables?

The variable that is not assigned any value is said to be undefined. It means that the variable is not defined by any value.

Null variable on the other hand is the variable that is defined but the value is not specified.

let a;
console.log(a); // undefined

let b = null;
console.log(b); // null
To determine whether the variable is null or undefined, == and === operators can be used. Both of them compares the variables but the difference is that Loose Equality Operator (==) treats null and undefined as the same and Strict Equality Operator (===) checks null and undefined separately.

Example 1:

let a;

if (a == null) {
	console.log('Null or undefined value');
} else {
	console.log(a);
} -->




<!-- Here, even the a is undefined but it will be treated the same as null because a loose equality operator has been used.

Example 2:

let a;

if (a === null) {
	console.log('Null Value');
} else if (a === undefined) {
	console.log('Undefined Value');
} -->




Here, since a strict equality operator has been used, we will consider null and undefined values as two different cases. Therefore, to check whether the variable is undefined or null, a strict equality operator (===) should be used.
