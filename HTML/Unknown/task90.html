<!-- JavaScript program to print sum of range with steps


We are going to create a JavaScript program that has a range function which takes two arguments start and end along with an optional argument step to determine step. The use of this function is to return an array containing all the elements from start to end incrementing one by one if step is not defined.

Next, we are going to take a sum function that accepts array as argument and calculates the sum of the array elements. In this function, we will use recursion instead of for loop for the sake of sophistication in this simple program.

Also in the range function, if step is less than 1, i.e., -1, then range will be as follows [5,4,3,2,1]


JavaScript code to find sum through range() function


function range(start, end, step) {
    var numbers = [];
    if(step === undefined)
      step = 1;
    if(step>0)
      for(var i=start; i<=end; i+=step) {
        numbers.push(i);
      }
    else
      for(var i=end; i>=start; i+=step) {
        numbers.push(i);
      }
    return numbers;
  }
  
  function sum(array) {
    if(array.length === 0)
      return 0;
    return array.pop() + sum(array);
  }
  
  console.log(sum(range(1,10,-1)));
