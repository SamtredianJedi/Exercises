<!-- JavaScript | Demonstrate the example of call by value in function -->

<!-- Here, we are designing a function named change() that has an argument and we are trying to change the value of the passed argument inside the function, but it will not effect to the main/actual argument that is passed as the argument while calling. Example:
a =10 Value before function call: a = 10 //calling function change(a) //changing inside the function a = 67 Value inside the function: a = 67 //printing the value after the function call Value after the function call: a =10 Code: -->
