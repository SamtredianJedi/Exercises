<!-- JavaScript - Add st, nd, rd and th (ordinal) suffix to a number


    


Now, for adding a suffix after a number, there is no direct method present in JavaScript. We can create a function with simple and basic logic for it. This function will return the number along with its appropriate suffix.

First, let's make clear where to use what suffix.

Generally, 'th' is used with every number except all the numbers ending with one, two, or three. Also, all the teen numbers starting from 13-19 do not use 'th' as their suffix.

The numbers ending with one use 'st' as their suffix (1, 21, 31, 41, ...) but 11 does not fall in this category.

Similarly, numbers ending with two use 'nd' as their suffix (2, 22, 32, 42, ...) but 12 does not fall in this category.

Also, the numbers ending with three use 'rd' as their suffix (3, 23, 33, 43, ...) but 13 does not fall in this category.

Now let's apply these conditions and create a function for this,

JavaScript code to add st, nd, rd and th (ordinal) suffix to a number
function addSuffix(i) {
    var a = i % 10,
        b = i % 100;

    if (a == 1 && b != 11) {
        console.log(i + "st");
    } else if (a == 2 && b != 12) {
        console.log(i + "nd");
    } else if (a == 3 && b != 13) {
        console.log(i + "rd");
    } else {
        console.log(i + "th");
    }
}
addSuffix(155); -->
