<!-- Replace multiple characters in one replace call using JavaScript

<!-- JavaScript replace() Method
It is one of the methods in JavaScript which is used for replacing a particular character or multiple characters in a string with some other character.

Syntax:

string.replace(oldVal, newValue);
Here, this method is applied to the string whose characters are needed to be replaced. It takes two parameters which are the value/character that has to be replaced and the new character.

But this way only one character can be replaced in a single replace() method. For replacing multiple characters, one can use more replace() methods over and over again.

Syntax:

string.replace(oldVal, newVal).replace(oldVal, newVal), ...
Example 1:

// using multiple replace:
let String = 'Replace^Multiple$Characters Using_Replace$Method.';
newString = String.replace('_', ':').replace('^', ' ').replace('$', '+');
console.log('Original String: ', String);
console.log('New String: ', newString);



This can be one way of replacing multiple characters using multiple replace() methods. But let's talk about doing this task by just using the single replace() method.

When only a single replace() method has to be used then regular expression comes into consideration. In place of the oldVal a regular expression is declared and in place of the newVal a new character is mentioned.

Example 2:

// using single replace:
let String = 'Replace^ Multiple$ Characters Using_ Replace$ Method.';
newString = String.replace(/\$|_|\^/gi, '');
console.log('Original String: ', String);
console.log('New String: ', newString); -->
