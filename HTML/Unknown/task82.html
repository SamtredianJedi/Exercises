<!-- JavaScript Reverse print an array

    

Arrays are an important data structures in any language. Reversing an array means printing the array elements in the reverse order.


var arr = [1,2,3,4,5];
var size = arr.length;
for(var i=size-1; i>=0; i--) {
  console.log(`Element ${i+1} is ${arr[i]}`);
}



In the first line the array is defined. Then with the size variable, we will store the length of the array. After that, we traverse the loop in reverse order, which is starting with "size-1" index, which is 4 in our case and we are iterating till the 0th index. Inside the loop, we print or work on our element.
