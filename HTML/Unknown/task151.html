<!-- Length of a JavaScript object



As we already know, an object in JavaScript is a variable or a variable with some properties in it.

Example:

 var person ={
    'name':'John',
    'age':'25'
};
In above example, person is an object with properties name and age.

To find the length of an object, there are following ways:

1) Using Object.keys() Method
This method will return the properties of the object as an array and length will print the length of that array i.e., the length of the object.

Example 1:

var universe = {
	'star': 'Sun',
	'planet': 'Earth',
	'satellite': 'Moon'
};

console.log(Object.keys(universe).length); -->






<!-- 2) Using hasOwnProperty() Method
With the help of a loop, this method will check whether the key is present in the object or not. If the key is present then it will Boolean value (True/False) which then will increment the count variable.

Example 2:

var universe = {
	'star': 'Sun',
	'planet': 'Earth',
	'satellite': 'Moon'
};

var key, count = 0;

for (key in universe) {
	if (universe.hasOwnProperty(key))
		count++;
}
objectlength = count;

console.log(objectlength); -->
