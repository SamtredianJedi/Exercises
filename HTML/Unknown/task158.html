<!-- What is the !! (not not) operator in JavaScript


-->



<!-- JavaScript's double not operator is basically double use of (!) operator. This is a logical not operator. (!!) operator converts non-Boolean to Boolean.

As you know, ! operator reverses the logic, i.e., it return false for !true value and true for !false.
 -->





<!-- Examples of (!) Operator
!false



It gives false for 1, because here 1 means true and 0 means false.

So simply, if we apply one more not operator in front of this, it will become double not and will give the reverse value of (!expression). As seen above, (!false) will give true, but (!!false) will give false.

Example for not not (!!) Operator
!!false




Here, the double negation / double not not (!!) operator calculates the truth value of a value. It returns a Boolean value. -->
