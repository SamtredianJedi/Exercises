<!-- Ways to create Date object in JavaScript

ate object in JavaScript is used quite often. Whether it is countdown timer for an event or picking up a date through user Input, Dates in JavaScript have a lot of use cases and in JavaScript we have got lot of ways to create Date object.

Creating date with Date constructor is the simplest way to create a date. Consider this example,

var today = new Date();
The Date() constructor creates a new date object and stores it inside the today variable and the value of this variable is, "Wed Oct 18 2017 00:45:58 GMT+0530 (India Standard Time)", ie the date-time when this object was created.

We can also define a specific date in the above format using this code,

var event = new Date('December 25, 2017 00:00:00');
This will create an event variable with the specified Date value given as a string. Also note, instead of providing month in words, we can provide the date-time format. The date time format is in following format, "YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS". Consider this example,

var event = new Date('2017-12-25T00:00:00');
While providing time string is preferred in this format, but you can also specify date without giving all fields. This is also valid in JavaScript and works perfectly fine.

var event = new Date(2017, 12, 25);
This will create an event object with only these values and other date parts as 00:00:00 by default. -->
