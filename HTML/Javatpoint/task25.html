<!-- HTML Paragraph -->

HTML paragraph or HTML p tag is used to define a paragraph in a webpage. Let's take a simple example to see how it work. It is a notable point that a browser itself add an empty line before and after a paragraph. An HTML
<p> tag indicates starting of new paragraph. Note: If we are using various
    <p> tags in one HTML file then browser automatically adds a single blank line between the two paragraphs. See this example:

        <p>This is first paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is second paragraph.</p>
        <p>This is third paragraph.</p>

        Space inside HTML Paragraph If you put a lot of spaces inside the HTML p tag, browser removes extra spaces and extra line while displaying the page. The browser counts number of spaces and lines as a single one.
