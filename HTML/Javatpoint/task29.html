<!-- HTML Symbols

    


There are many mathematical, technical and currency symbols which are not present on a normal keyboard. We have to use HTML entity names to add such symbols to an HTML page.

If there no entity name exists, you can use an entity number, a decimal, or hexadecimal reference.

Example:

<!DOCTYPE html>     
      <html>        
       <body>    
          <h3>The Currency Symbols</h3>  
                   <p>This is Indian Rupee symbol <b>₹<b></p>   
         <p>This is Euro symbol <b>€</b></p>      
         <p> This is Dollar symbol <b>#36;</b></p>    
       </body>      
    </html>
