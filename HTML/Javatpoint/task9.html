<!-- HTML Elements

    

An HTML file is made of elements. These elements are responsible for creating web pages and define content in that webpage. An element in HTML usually consist of a start tag
<tag name>, close tag </tag name> and content inserted between them. Technically, an element is a collection of start tag, attributes, end tag, content between them. Note: Some elements does not have end tag and content, these elements are termed as empty elements
or self-closing element or void elements. Such as:

<p> Hello world!!! </p>

Example
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>

<head>
    <title>WebPage</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>This is my first web page</h1>
    <h2> How it looks?</h2>
    <p>It looks Nice!!!!!</p>
</body>

</html>


All the content written between body elements are visible on web page. Void element: All the elements in HTML do not require to have start tag and end tag, some elements does not have content and end tag such elements are known as Void elements or empty
elements. These elements are also called as unpaired tag. Some Void elements are <br> (represents a line break) ,
<hr>(represents a horizontal line), etc. Nested HTML Elements: HTML can be nested, which means an element can contain another element. Block-level and Inline HTML elements For the default display and styling purpose in HTML, all the elements are divided into
two categories: Block-level element Inline element Block-level element: These are the elements, which structure main part of web page, by dividing a page into coherent blocks. A block-level element always start with new line and takes the full width of
web page, from left to right. These elements can contain block-level as well as inline elements. Following are the block-level elements in HTML.

<address>, <article>, <aside>, <blockquote>, <canvas>, <dd>, <div>, <dl>, <dt>, <fieldset>, <figcaption>, <figure>, <footer>, <form>, <h1>-<h6>, <header>, <hr>, <li>, <main>, <nav>, <noscript>, <ol>, <output>, <p>, <pre>, <section>, <table>, <tfoot>, <ul> and <video>.
