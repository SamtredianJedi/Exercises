// Java Program to print the number of elements present in an array



In this program, we need to count and print the number of elements present in the array.

The number of elements present in the array can be found by calculating the length of the array.

Length of above array is 5. Hence, the number of elements present in the array is 5.

Algorithm
STEP 1: START
STEP 2: INITIALIZE arr = {1,2,3,4,5}
STEP 3: PRINT arr.length
STEP 4: EXIT
Program:
public class CountArray {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
      //Initialize array  
        int [] arr = new int [] {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};  
      //Number of elements present in an array can be found using the length  
        System.out.println("Number of elements present in given array: " + arr.length);  
    }  
}
